# â˜• Public Coffee Machine System

### ðŸ§© Description  
**Public Coffee Machine System** is a Java-based simulation that models the operation of a public coffee vending machine â€” like those found in universities, hospitals, or on the street.  
The system simulates user interaction, payment processing, drink preparation, ingredient management, and maintenance alerts.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. The user can select a drink from the menu.  
2. The system accepts payments and returns change if needed.  
3. The system checks ingredient availability before preparing a drink.  
4. The drink is prepared and dispensed if ingredients are sufficient.  
5. The system alerts maintenance when ingredients run low.  
6. The system generates a maintenance and transaction report.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Reliability:** The system should be available 99% of the time.  
2. **Performance:** Drink preparation should not exceed 2 minutes.  
3. **Usability:** Simple and intuitive user interface.  
4. **Security:** Payment data should be handled safely.  
5. **Scalability:** New drink types can be easily added.
